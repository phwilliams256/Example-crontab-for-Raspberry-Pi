# Example-crontab-for-Raspberry-Pi
This is an example crontab for Raspberry Pi.  It includes running scripts at boot up as well as scheduled running of scripts.  While the examples are Raspberry Pi specific the general methods are universal to the Linux OS.

Scheduling data collection events is critical for highly automated IoT systems.

Programs can be scheduled to run at boot time or anytime throughout the day.

This is a link to the LibreTexts explaining how to use this crontab example.
